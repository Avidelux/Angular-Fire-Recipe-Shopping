Future things to add and improve:
    - BUG: Placeholder-Images are only displayed correctly after page-reload, which is most likely caused by Angular (see issue raised here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/7845)
    - FEATURE: Adding a firebase-database instead of relying on local, predefined arrays
    - FEATURE: Making the input-field for "Steps" the recipe-creation-form dynamic, so it is possible to directly add each step on its own
